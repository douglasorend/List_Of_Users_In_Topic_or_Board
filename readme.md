# LIST OF USERS IN FORUM/TOPIC/BOARD v3.1
[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4015)

-------

## Introduction
This mod modifies the Message Index and Post Display templates so that list of users in the board or topic is moved **from** above the topic list or start of the post **to** just above the Quick Reply box, and adds phpBB-like styling to the list.  It also alters the Board Index so that the list of users online is controlled by permission.

## Admin Settings
There is a new admin page at **Admin** -> **Features and Options** -> **Who's Online**.  It takes the **Enable Who's Online list** and **User online time threshold** options from **General** tab and places them under the **Who's Online**.

There is a new option in v2.0 that removes the membergroup coloring that the user belongs to from the users online list.

There are 3 new permisions that allow membergroups to be able to view the users online list for:

- the Board Index ([nobbc]/index.php[/nobbc])
- the Message Index ([nobbc]index.php?board=x[/nobbc])
- the Post Display ([nobbc]index.php?t=x[/nobbc])

There are new options in v3.0 that allows you to move the "Who's Online" box to the top or bottom of the screen, as well as a section controlling whether the "Who's Online" section shows nothing, only numbers, or members for all installed themes.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.15, but should work on SMF 2.1 Beta 3, as well as SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 2.1 Beta 1 and 2, as well as SMF 1.x, will not be supported.
